# GG2TWS_slepian
This is a spectral-domain joint inversion model based on Slepian basis functions, which jointly inverts GNSS and GRACE data for inferring large-scale TWS changes and is performed by generating displacement data at GRACE virtual stations. A variational Bayesian PCA-based is integrated into our inversion model to handle random data missing in GNSS and long-term data gaps in GRACE. 
This work is published in Journal of Hydrology.
